# Talk
You might have heard of this thing called AI agents that have been transforming our industry lately. While there exist a plethora of ways to prototype agents, operating these in production brings a new set of challenges. This talk demonstrates why Go is uniquely suited for building scalable, production-ready agent systems. We'll build an LLM agent from scratch without using any agent frameworks, scale our system out to a multi-agent architecture, and leverage Go's cloud-native ecosystem to operate agents at scale.
