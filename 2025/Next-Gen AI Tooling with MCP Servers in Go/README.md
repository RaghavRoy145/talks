# Talk
Step into this new era of AI-powered tools with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server! This session will teach you how to expose your APIs directly into the IDE of your users so they can interact with your systems using natural language. The talk will center around a step-by-step demo where we'll write an MCP server together using the brand new github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk library. By the end of this session, youâ€™ll be equipped with the knowledge to build your own MCP server to support your AI-enabled users.
