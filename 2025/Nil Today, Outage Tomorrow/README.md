# Talk
We’ve all been there… you deploy in the afternoon and then stroll into work the next day to find everything is broken in production. You sit down, start debugging and checking the logs, and then you find the dreaded nil exception. Come along to my talk to learn how you can use your GoLand IDE to spot nil dereference errors before your code hits production. Avoid panics, embrace safety, and sleep well!
