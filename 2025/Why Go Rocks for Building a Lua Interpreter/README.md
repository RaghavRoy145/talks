# Why Go Rocks for Building a Lua Interpreter - Roxy Light

[Slides and Transcript](https://www.zombiezen.com/blog/2025/08/gophercon-2025-lightning-talk/)

## Abstract

Many Go programs are web services or clients for web APIs. But Go can do more than that! The same features that make Go productive for writing backend systems also make Go ideal for writing a programming language interpreter. In this talk, Roxy will share her experience with writing a Lua interpreter in Go as part of the new zb build tool. You’ll learn how the interpreter is structured and what it took to adapt a mid-sized C library into Go.
