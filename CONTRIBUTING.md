# Contributing

All GopherCon speakers are invited to add their slides and other presentation materials to this repo to make them available to all.

To add your talk, submit a PR that:

- Adds a new folder named the same as your talk, under the appropriate year, with your slides, etc. If you would prefer to link to your own site instead, simply add a `README.md` with a summary of your talk and links to the content.
- Updates the title of your talk on the main page to be a link to the folder you added.

Feel free to add any additional biography information you would like included in your "page" as well.
